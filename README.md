# Learn OpenGL with Go
[Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com) is an online book to learn OpenGL programming. It uses C because OpenGL is written in C. I did the project in Go because I already know the syntax and the build tooling is much easier.

The [`go-gl`](https://github.com/go-gl) project is used to provide Go bindings to the underlying C OpenGL libraries. If you want to run the code in this repository, follow [this guide](https://github.com/go-gl/glfw?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) to ensure the dependencies of GLFW are installed.
